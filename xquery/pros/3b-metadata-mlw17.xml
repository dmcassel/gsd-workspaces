This workspace considers metadata.

Metadata is used to enable data governance, documentation and quality.
Metadata about models can be used to cite sources of data, history of the model,
stakeholders, or any number of other aspects of data management used to contextualize
the model or the data conforming to it.  It might also describe equvalencies
aor differences among models.  There is no limit really.

Metadata about instances could cite source systems and decisions about value origins,
confidence scores, or editorial.
