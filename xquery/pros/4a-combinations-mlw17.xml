This workspace explores various use cases and techniques for combining the options you have for
querying documents and data in MarkLogic.

Since there are different kinds of indexes and query languages in MarkLogic, sometimes you will
want to manage various aspects of your data in different modes, and hence the combination of APIs
and query languages may provide simplicity and performance boosts for your use cases.
